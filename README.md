# Kubernetes The Easy Way (Part 2)


Based on Kelsey Hightower's (of Google) <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way">Kubernetes The Hard Way</a> (updated on August 31, 2017!)

Kubernetes The Hard Way is a fun project, created by Kelsey Hightower (of Google), which walks a user through each of the many manual steps to stand up a basic Kubernetes cluster on Google Compute Platform. I performed the steps manually at least three times before embarking on automating the steps using Terraform and Ansible.

## Dependencies

[Terraform](http://www.terraform.io)
[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)
